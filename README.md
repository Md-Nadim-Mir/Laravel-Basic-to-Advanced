 # What is laravel
  * Laravel is an open-source PHP framework, which is robust and easy to understand. 
  * It follows a model-view-controller design pattern.
  * Laravel reuses the existing components of different frameworks which helps in creating a web application.
  * The web application thus designed is more structured and pragmatic.
